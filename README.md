There are 8 files (including this README file) in this folder.

* useful_functions: This is module (.py file) created to keep some useful functions (plots and data extraction) used in the analysis of both covid and stop&search data. 

* specimenDate_ageDemographic-unstacked: This is the covid data. It is a .csv file.

* GUI: It is a .py file which provides the end user with a single starting point to run the programs in the folder.
